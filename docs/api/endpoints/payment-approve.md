### Fields Updated on Approval

| Field | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `status` | `pending` | `approved` |
| `pending` | `true` | `false` |
| `approved_by` | `null` | Finance user's ID |
| `approved_at` | `null` | Current UTC timestamp |

### Notes
- The `exchange_rate`, `amount_eur`, and `rate_source` fields remain unchanged — they were captured at creation time and are immutable.
- After approval, the request cannot be approved or rejected again — any further action returns `400`.

### Use Cases
- Finance team reviewing and approving employee payment submissions
- Triggering downstream payment processing after approval
